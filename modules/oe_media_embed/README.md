# OpenEuropa Media Embed module

The OpenEuropa Media Embed module integrates with OE OEmbed to provide a Media-based embed button.

This module serves as a BC legacy bridge between the old media-based embed button and the new
generic one that has been moved to OE OEmbed.

# Dependencies

This module depends on the OE OEmbed module so make sure you add it to your composer.json:

```
composer require openeuropa/oe_oembed
```
