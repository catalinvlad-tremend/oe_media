Feature: Reusable Behat context
  In order to reuse this project's Behat contexts
  As a developer
  I want to make sure that they work as expected.

  @av_portal
  Scenario: I can create media using Behat steps
    Given am on homepage
    And the following AV Portal photos:
      | url                                                         |
      | https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/photo/P-038924~2F00-15  |
      | https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/photo/P-039321~2F00-04  |
    And the following documents:
      | name       | file       |
      | Document 1 | sample.pdf |
      | Document 2 | sample.pdf |
    And the following images:
      | name    | file           | alt                |
